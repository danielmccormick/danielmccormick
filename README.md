### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Computer Engineering. I'm not great at updating these public profiles these days, but I'm recently interned at Amazon (specifically AWS) doing SDE, and previously interned at [SideFX](https://www.sidefx.com/) doing 3D R&D, [Cepton](https://www.cepton.com/) doing Lidar R&D, and [Wind River Systems](https://www.windriver.com/), doing prototyping for the InfoDev team. 

No follows, stars, or features otherwise are an endorsement of any form. Also any bad code here isn't mine.
