### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo, with a major in Computer Engineering. I'm not great at updating these public profiles these days, but I'm currently employed by Meta working on Messaging Infrastructure. I've done internships at Facebook/Meta (working on infra), Amazon (specifically AWS), and [SideFX](https://www.sidefx.com/) (doing 3D R&D), [Cepton](https://www.cepton.com/) (doing Lidar R&D), and [Wind River Systems](https://www.windriver.com/) (doing compiler prototyping)

Most of my interesting repos at this point in time are private ðŸ˜…

No follows, stars, or features otherwise are an endorsement of any form. Also any bad code here isn't mine.
